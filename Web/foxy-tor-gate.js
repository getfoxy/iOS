/* foxy-tor-gate.js — the screens between launch and a private connection.
 *
 * Foxy reaches the network through its own Tor. The native side owns that
 * state and routes every request by it: a request it cannot send through Tor
 * it refuses, unless the person using the app chose to continue unprotected
 * this session. So nothing here is enforcement. These screens say what the
 * state is and offer the two ways forward.
 *
 * Replaces foxy-vpn-gate.js, which decided privacy in nine places that had to
 * agree — Orbot, a system VPN, an exposed mode, embedded Tor — and repeatedly
 * did not. There is now one question, asked of one place: is Tor up?
 *
 * What the person can see:
 *   CONNECTING TO TOR       — launch, and every return from the background,
 *                             while a private connection is set up; RESTART
 *                             TOR while the native side says Tor is stuck
 *   OPENING YOUR WALLET     — then the mint and the balance, on the same screen
 *   CANNOT CONNECT TO TOR   — RETRY, or CONTINUE UNPROTECTED
 *   TOR STOPPED             — Tor's thread has exited and cannot start again
 *                             inside Foxy: reopen Foxy, or CONTINUE UNPROTECTED
 *   the app                 — Tor is up and the balance loaded, or they chose
 *                             to continue
 *
 * Once Tor has been up since launch or the last return, losing it shows no
 * screen: requests are refused until it is back, and the place a request was
 * refused says so.
 * Continuing unprotected lasts until Tor connects — Tor keeps trying, and the
 * app moves onto it when it does — or until the app is closed.
 *
 * Self-managed DOM, like foxy-send-progress.js: built with createElement and
 * updated by writing styles directly, never through the design runtime.

   * into working offline instead and stays down. The banner at the foot of

   * waits a few seconds for a connection that is on its way rather than take
   * the offline branch (`routeSoon`, in the wallet).

   * The first launch after install opens with the drawing the splash is a still
   * of: the fox sleeping, stretching, standing. It sits
   * over everything this file draws, so nothing else in the launch has to know
   * about it — Tor connects underneath, and the CONNECTING screen is simply
   * not seen until the fox is done.
   *
   * The first frame of the video is the splash art, at the same size and in
   * the same place, so the hand-over from the native splash is invisible: what
   * was a still starts moving.
   *
   * Placement is arithmetic, not taste. The drawing is 800 x 526 with the
   * sleeping fox 66.75% of it wide and its middle 43% down; the splash puts
   * that fox across 61% of the screen, centred. So the frame is drawn 91.4% of
   * the screen wide (61 / 66.75), and lifted so that point sits at the middle:
   * 50% - 0.43 x 60.1vw. Change the artwork and all four numbers change.
