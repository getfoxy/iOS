/* flashcard-card.js — a model of the Foxy card, for tests.
 *
 * The card is a JavaCard applet (the card's own repository, https://github.com/getfoxy/card;
 * its commands are in docs/FOXY-CARD-SPEC.md there). A wallet cannot be tested against a card
 * in a test run, so this answers the same commands with the same bytes: APDUs
 * in, as hex, and the answer out with its status word. It is held to the
 * applet by tests/flashcard-model.js, which replays a conversation the applet
 * had under jCardSim and compares every answer.
 *
 *     const card = makeCard({ window, key });  // window: the page's (its CashuTS signs); key: 64 hex
 *     makeCard({ window, format: 4 })            // the card that signs once for a payment: the latest software, 1.16 (`software: 15` and before are the cards before it)
 *     makeCard({ window, format: 4, floorBits: 0x207fffff })   // the least work a block header must show: the real floor unless a test mines its own headers
 *     const answer = await card.send('b001000000');
 *     card.tap();                                // the card leaves and comes back
 *     card.leaveAfter(2);                        // it leaves the field two commands from now
 *     card.setNonce(hex)                         // the nonce it last gave is this one (replaying a recording of the applet)
 *     card.setChange(nonceHex, rHex)             // the next change it makes for itself has this nonce and this blinding factor (same)
 *
 * Not a card: no EEPROM, no torn writes inside a command, and it signs in
 * microseconds. What it has in common is every rule the applet enforces.
